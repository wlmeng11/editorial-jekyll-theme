The “back” of the inchworm is a sheet of plywood cut in such a way as to form a flexible [living hinge](https://www.ponoko.com/blog/how-to-make/how-to-design-a-living-hinge/). A continuous rotation servo winds a winch which serves to flex and release the inchworm’s back, causing it to slide along the metal rails. Finally, the “feet” of the inchworm are comprised of plastic rollers which are controlled by servo motors in order to either roll forward, or be held perpendicular to the direction of motion, thus serving as a locking mechanism.
